TODO NOTES

stack_kerasfit
--------------

- parallelization of tokenization, cleaning, padding and other steps -> much improved performance
- correct implementation of optional CNN and RNN / LSTM for main output, after word vector embedding
- test different dropout and batch normalization settings
- caching functionality is not very defensive and requires manual config changes, that should be changed
